        <p>Getting a job can be frustrating.  It can be especially frustrating when you don't know where to look.  At Bounty Board, we are trying to make that a little easier.</p><br>
        <p>Here, you just need to know what you're looking for.  We'll check multiple databases for you, and then bring all the results back and put them in a format that's easy to understand.</p>

        <p>It's pretty simple! Just put in the keywords you're looking for, like "java" and "developer", the location you're looking in, and click 'Search Jobs.' That's all you have to do!</p><br>
        <p>If you find that you're getting a lot of results from one database that aren't useful, don't worry! Click on the 'Customize Job Boards' button to open a menu of all the available databases.  Select ones you want results from, and de-select ones that you don't. Click 'Save Changes' and you're ready to go!</p><br>
        <p>We've now added a feature to save your search terms! If you want to remember the search terms you used, click 'Save Search Terms.' You'll be prompted to enter a unique id for your search.  Once this done, you can always load saved searches.  If you have a saved search loaded and you save it, it will edit the saved terms rather than creating a new saved search.  When selecting a saved search, clicking the close button will delete the saved search forever.</p>
